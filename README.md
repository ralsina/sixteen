# Sixteen

Sixteen is a Crystal library to access Base-16 theme data.

It embeds the whole base16 theme set, so you can use it in your applications without having to track things down and carry them
around (the bad news: it adds about .5MB to your binary).

The API is not defined yet, it will grow as I use it in other
projects (I am not doing this for fun, I am doing it because I need it ðŸ¤£)

For more information on base16, check [Tinted Theming](https://github.com/tinted-theming/home)
