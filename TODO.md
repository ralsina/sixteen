# Things to do

* ✅ Look at selenite to add hsv/hsl support
* ✅ Add color modification capabilities (this color, but 10% brighter and such)
* Add color lookup in palettes (palette color closest to this one)
* Support for calculating theme from image?
* Querying for a contrasting color pair within the palette
